       An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone.
     The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!”.This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.
Novice pet parents, beware.Dogs of this breed are sensitive and need plenty of companionship and open space.

         This massive breed is highly territorial and won’t back down from a fight, even against bears or wolves. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, but their stubborn, independent nature can make them difficult to train. Their natural distrust of strangers and other animals can also lead to aggressive tendencies if an experienced trainer doesn’t keep them in check.

       <h1> <b>Samoyed</b> </h1>
       <p>Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion
 for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by
sleeping on top of them at night.As a working breed, Samoyeds can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain
friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs. They’re affectionate with almost everyone, so long as new people don’t mind some
shedding and stray hairs on their clothes.Samoyeds' friendly and affable disposition makes them poor guard dogs.

       <h1> <b>Tibetan Mastiff</b> </h1>
       <p>Watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme.
 These densely-coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial
 with strangers.It’s impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like “powerful,” “muscular,” “massive,”
 and “substantial.”It uses all the usual livestock guardian tactics(e.g., barking, scent-marking perimeters) to warn away predators and avoid direct confrontations.Leaving a Tibetan mastiff
outside all night with neighbors nearby is not recommended. They often sleep during the day, making them more active, alert
 and aware at night.
